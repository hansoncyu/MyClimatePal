# MyClimatePal

MyClimatePal is a food diary that lets you log the food you eat. It is similar to MyFitnessPal but instead of providing information about nutrition, it gives information about the food's environmental impact.
The application tells you how much CO2 equivalent was produced and how much water was used to make the food you eat. 
It comes with a database of common foods but if you don't see the food you just ate, you can do some research about its environmental cost and add it to the database for everyone to use.

## Installation

If you want to play around with the code, pull the repository and install the dependencies with npm.
```
npm install
```

### Layout

DB includes files related to the database and server. MyClimatePal uses Express and Node.js with a MongoDB database.

Client includes files related to the front end. ReactJS is used to power the front end.
